## Jammming



### Introduction
This project is about a React web application called Jammming. By interacting with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

### Features
Below is a list of the website's features:

- Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account. You will need to follow the steps in the Spotify Developer Guide to register your application.
- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).
- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
- Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.
